Spring boot has 4 features

1)AutoConfiguration
In Spring framework,we were forced to configure a lot
like for example configuring dispatcher servlet,view resolver, hibrenate
jackson,logger,aspect,tomcat...................

In spring boot, we do not need to manually configure everything,its autoconfigured
we call this autoconfiguration

Devs o springboot has provided pre developed autoconfigured classes for almost everything be it
web,jpa,aspect,test under a dependency called org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure
which comes with spring boot project

SB(spring boot) calls this classes based on two cases

1)SB first scans the dependencies resent under the classpath
2)It then fetches the given configuration from application.properties file

based on first step ,it decides which autoconfiguration class to call
areey bancho....everything gets auto configured

2)Spring boot starter project
  to create an web app, we need spring-boot-starter-web ,its collection of many
  dependencies like spring-boot-starter-tomcat spring-boot-starter-json spring-webmvc
  which is further a collection of dependencies

  this is just not to bloat the pom with huge dependency list

3)Spring boot devtool
   it acts like live server , save the changes and changes gets reflected

4)Spring boot profiles
  we deploy changes in multiple environments, and every env have differnt configs
  spring profile is just to have mutiple configs setup for different envs
