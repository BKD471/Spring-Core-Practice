Spring IOC container is in charge of bean creation, and injecting them
where its needed,it manages the entire bean lifecycle

To tell ioc container to manage the beans we need three things

1)Declare the beans in project
2)Describe their dependencies between themselves
3)Specify the locations, where they can be found---->this is also called scanning the beans

BEAN SCOPES

Singleton: Only one instance of bean will be created in container
every time we erquest a instance of a bean that was previously created, that same bean will be
delivered and no new instance will be created

note: all service layer bins which are supposed to be immutable are all singleton scoped


Prototype:Every time we request an instance of a bean, everytime it will be created in container

Request: for each HTTP request new instance will be created

Session: for each HTTP session, a new instance will
be created

Application:  creates the bean instances
for lifecycle of a servletcontext


WEBSOCKET

websckt: beans are stored in wbsckt session attributes

its  protocol that is responsible for creating bi directional
communication between client and host

for chatting apps, websocket is used

As long as communications is happening between client and host,
that created instance wil be there

for new socket connection new instance will be created
